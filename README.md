Project Introduction - Chess Game in Rust
- for my project I decided to create a functional game of chess in rust
- I want to be able to create a board that players would be able to interact with and face off against another player or engine
- in this project I feel like I'll be able to use many aspects of rust from creating the board, to taking inputs from players, to making pieces move in specific sequences, etc.
- I hope to have a higher level understanding of rust when I see all the pieces moving together
- I chose to work on this project because I used to play chess competitively when I was a lot younger; so, it seemed like a good way to get myself back into chess since I have wanted to for a while now

System Overview
- Create Board
- Create Pieces on Board
- Give Pieces Their Movements
- Allow Players to Interact With Pieces
- Give Pieces Ability to Take Other Pieces
- Establish Turns
- Establish Optional Timer
- Implement Special Rules {Castling, Checks, Checkmates, Enpassant, Pawns Upgrading}
- Declare Winner After Mate or Timer Runs Out
- Create Menu for Players Start Game and Pick Timer

Possible Challenges
- implementing the special rules seems like one of the more diffiult parts of this project
- other than that it would probably be how pieces interact with other pieces to make sure no behaviors happen that can lead to players performing illegal moves

References
- none so far
